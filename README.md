# Slickdeals+

*Have you ever looked in DevTools while browsing slickdeals.net?*

*It's mind-boggling how much useless (to the visitor) stuff it downloads, __uploads__ to other servers and stores on your computer*

This userscript enhances your Slickdeals browsing experience by blocking ads and trackers, adding powerful filtering and highlighting options, and giving you more control over the page layout. It's designed to be fast, stable, and privacy-respecting.

Features:
- **Modern UI**: A clean dropdown menu integrated directly into the Slickdeals navigation bar.
- **Advanced Ad & Nuisance Blocking**: Hides feed ads, "Just For You" sections, and promoted deals using dynamic CSS for better performance.
- **Flexible Highlighting**:
    - Highlight deals based on score (e.g., +40).
    - Highlight deals based on discount percentage (e.g., 50% off).
    - Special "Gold Tier" highlighting for deals that meet both score and discount criteria.
    - Customizable colors for all highlight types.
- **Powerful Filtering**:
    - Instantly filter the feed to show only "Free" items.
    - Filter for "Gold Tier" deals to see only the best-rated, highest-discount offers.
- **Customizable Layout**:
    - Toggle the side column to maximize content space.
    - Move the price above the deal title with the "Price First" option.
    - Display the calculated dollar and percentage difference on deals.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing is done on your computer. No user data or browsing history is sent to third-party servers.
