*Have you ever looked in DevTools while browsing slickdeals.net?*

*It's mind-boggling how much useless (to the visitor) stuff it downloads, __uploads__ to other servers and stores on your computer*

This userscript allows block most, if not all, __ads__ and __trackers__, thus making the website more responsive and privacy-friendly.

Features:
* Ad-blocking
* Display price and percent difference between original and sale prices
* Highlight items based on the score
* Highlight items based on price difference
* Highlight free items
* Show only free items
* Customizable highlight colors
* Resolve links (it sends a URL to a 3rd party service which returns final destination of that URL)
